# RoboScrubbers
Techin 540 Final Project

# RoboScrubbers: Autonomous Elevator Cleaning Robot

# Overview
RoboScrubbers is an innovative solution designed to automate elevator cleaning in high-traffic areas like transit stations, corporate offices, and residential complexes. The robot is capable of navigating to elevators, identifying dirt or contaminants, cleaning surfaces using suction or a picker, and disinfecting with UV light. RoboScrubbers streamlines the cleaning process, reduces human effort, and enhances sanitation standards.

# Features
Autonomous/Remote Controlled Navigation: Efficiently navigates to and from elevator spaces.
Contaminant Detection: Uses advanced sensors to identify dirt, spills, and other contaminants.
Cleaning Mechanism: Equipped with suction and picker systems for thorough cleaning.

# Project Roadmap
## Phase 1: Research & Requirement Analysis (Sep 2024 - Dec 2024)
Interviews, surveys, and feedback from potential users.
Primary and secondary research to understand user needs.
## Phase 2: Prototyping & Testing (Jan 2025 - Mar 2025)
Develop prototypes for deployment in test environments.
Collect real-world data to refine functionality.
## Phase 3: Market Engagement & Launch (Apr 2025 - Jun 2025)
Present to transit organizations and corporate stakeholders.
Prepare for commercial launch and scaling.
